A Pure Dark theme with the highest contrast ratio eyes has ever known.
I have been struggling a lot with all the outdated IntelliJ UI components; looking at what is the industry offers, we
still tied to 10 years old Java UI. Additionally, we have themes that make it harder to make the IDE look nicer on
High-Resolution displays.
Yet I decided to eliminate all the clutter in the IDE and use a Pure #000000 and Pure #FFFFFF based theme.

## Tips üåü

- Use one of the awesome fonts in [here](https://github.com/ProgrammingFonts/ProgrammingFonts)!
- Make Sure to hide all the non-essential Windows Tools, go to View | Appearance | Uncheck what's not important; for
  myself, I keep only (Status Bar, Toolbar), and Keyboard Shortcuts is enough.
- Use a good IDE font to Preferences | Appearance & Behavior | Appearance | Check "Use custom font" | Select "Futura"
  for example.

## Thanks üôèüèª

Thanks to [Zihan Ma](https://github.com/WhiteVermouth), who created
the [Xcode-Theme](https://github.com/WhiteVermouth/XcodeTheme) that this project is based on. Without that starting
point, this plugin may have never been created.
